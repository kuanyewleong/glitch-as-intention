# Glitch as Intention: The Wabi-Sabi of AI Art
By aligning AI glitch art with the philosophy of Wabi-Sabi, this work invites viewers to reconsider their relationship with technology—not as a force striving for sterile perfection, but as a medium capable of expressing organic, transient, and deeply human aesthetics.

In an era where artificial intelligence strives for precision, optimization, and flawlessness, Glitch as Intention stands as a meditation on the beauty of imperfection. Rooted in the Japanese philosophy of Wabi-Sabi (侘び寂び), this work reimagines computational glitches not as errors, but as profound moments of aesthetic significance. It challenges the rigid ideals of perfection that define contemporary computer vision systems and, instead, embraces the unpredictability and transience that lie at the heart of both human creativity and machine learning.

Glitch aesthetics usually focus on human artistic interpretation. This work, however, demonstrates how they are interpreted by AI models. This could explore the tension between human aesthetics and machine failure, which is rarely addressed in traditional glitch art.

There has been considerable discussion and numerous artistic explorations centered around the concept of wabi-sabi in digital art too. However, a critical gap remains: the lack of a structured approach to understanding how different types of computer vision glitches influence the final aesthetic of AI-generated artwork. Existing works often explore these distortions in an abstract or isolated manner, without systematically categorizing and analyzing their distinct visual impacts.

Additionally, existing works focus on two approaches: (1) prompting models to generate wabi-sabi-inspired aesthetics or (2) fine-tuning models to produce polished, curated imperfections. However, these approaches often overlook the core philosophy of wabi-sabi—embracing the incomplete, the fleeting, and the beautifully flawed.

This project reinterprets computational glitches not as errors to be corrected, but as moments of profound aesthetic significance. By showcasing AI-generated art shaped by different types of computer vision glitches, we reveal an organic, unintended beauty—one that truly aligns with the essence of wabi-sabi.

Glitch as Intention addresses the above gaps by identifying and categorizing ten major types of computer vision glitches that significantly alter AI-generated art:
* Analog distortions from hardware malfunctions,
* Pixel scrambling,
* Digital dithering,
* Data moshing,
* Video frame skips/tearing,
* Data compression artifacts,
* Color banding,
* Digital channel shifts,
* Noise and grain,
* Over-exposure, and
* Combination of all the above

To illustrate the impact of each glitch type, we present a curated AI-generated artwork corresponding to each category. This structured approach not only provides a novel perspective on the interplay between computational errors and digital aesthetics but also establishes a foundation for future explorations in glitch-inspired AI artistry.
